# IoT Outlier Data Visualization

This project is a Flask web application that visualizes IoT outlier data in real-time. It fetches temperature and humidity data from a server and displays it on a dashboard using Highcharts. The dashboard updates every few seconds to show the latest data.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3
- Flask
- Pandas
- Highcharts
- Bootstrap

## Features

- Real-time visualization of temperature and humidity data.
- Updates the dashboard every few seconds.
- Displays outlier data points for temperature and humidity.

## Project Structure

The project files are organized as follows:

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file containing the routes and data processing logic.
- `templates/index.html`: The HTML template for the dashboard.
- `static/`: Directory containing static files such as CSS and JavaScript.
- `data.json`: Sample data file containing temperature and humidity readings.

## Customization

You can customize the project as per your requirements. Some possible modifications include:

- Changing the data source: Update the `data` function in `app.py` to fetch data from a different server or API.
- Modifying the dashboard layout: Edit the `index.html` file to change the structure or design of the dashboard.
- Adding additional charts: Extend the JavaScript code in `index.html` to include more charts or visualizations.
